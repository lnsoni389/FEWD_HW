											<h3>About Me</h3>
										</header>
										<p>As a biology graduate from George Mason University, the intersection of creativity, development, research and analysis is inherent to me. After several years of working in the life sciences and being unhappy with the progression of my career, I began exploring different areas of interest that could lead to something more enjoyable, promising, and satisfyingâ€”web design and the marketing strategies that surround the promotion of these digital touchpoints. I joined several professional organizations in Washington, D.C. geared towards empowering women in technology where I could learn from others and apply this knowledge and insight to my own life.</p>

			<p>Fast forward through many hours of self-teaching and formal instruction at Georgetown University (Digital Marketing) and General Assembly (Front-End Web Development), by day I am front-end web specialist with a lot of digital strategy and project management savvy. I have had invaluable opportunities to work with seasoned professionals in the design, digital marketing and development realms. These professional experiences have allowed me the opportunity to strategically engage and inspire users, but have left me hungry and wanting more.</p>

			<p>These insights inspired me to establish NERDY GIRL Designs and provide my clients with creative solutions to their branding, design and development, digital strategy, and analysis and reporting needs. I am a data driven and analytical individual who is able to approach problems and develop creative solutions with design-based thinking. I have managed email campaigns from start to finish, including content creation, planning, testing, evaluating, and reporting. Within my current role, I work closely with a team of developers and content curators while simultaneously ensuring excellent search engine optimization for content marketing purposes. I have many years of experience utilizing databases for digital marketing and business intelligence purposes. I am one-part front-end developer and one-part marketing automation machine. I have a track record of implementing, managing and executing scalable digital strategies with passion, precision and excellence. I would love the opportunity to utilize creative solutions and data-backed decisions to engage and inspire your users.</p>
