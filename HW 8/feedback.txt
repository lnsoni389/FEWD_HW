Style forms lightly using CSS

Additional Comments:

 - Great job! Nice variety of input fields and consistent styling.

 - Nice use of placeholder text and 'required' attribute to get automatic validation.

 - Don't forget you can use the 'for' attribute on labels to associate labels and input fields. E.g. <label for="txtName">Name:</label><input type="text" id="txtName">
