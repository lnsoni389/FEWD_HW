  -Your code is really close to being right on this. The only problem is that you have an extra space. In line 141 in the CSS:
  p:: first-letter     <--what you have
  p::first-letter      <--what it should be
  So annoying, right? But take away that space, and it works!


Additional Comments:

Lauren, this looks great! Definitely getting the hang of this. And I like the Breaking Bad text.

For your images, I noticed that you have them in the CSS and not the HTML. The way you did it isn't technically wrong, but it's not the best way. I was a little confused about the difference between HTML images and CSS images when I first started coding too. So, HTML images take up space. Nothing goes on top of them. CSS images are background images, just like you would make a background color. Stuff can go on top of them. So for this page, since the images don't have anything on top of them, it's better to put them in the HTML in an image tag. For something like the homework last week, where the Relaxr text was on top of image, the image had to go in the CSS. That was kind of a rambly explanation. Let me know if you have any questions about this.

One more little thing: in your CSS, when you use a font that is more than one word, you should put quotes around it, like:
font-family: "Open Sans", "Times New Roman", Helvetica, serif;
Some browsers are smart enough to know what you mean without the quotes, but it's better to have them so that the browser understands it's all the same font (and not two different fonts).

Overall, this looks really good. Nice job!
